# Forecastr Code Challenge

Welcome to the Forecastr Code Challenge.
In this challenge, you'll help Trisha with her vending point.

## Installation

Before starting the project, be sure to have docker installed and create your postgres database.

```bash
docker run --name takehome -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=takehome -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

## Before Starting

After installing the Docker Image, you should start the project setup. That part we got it covered!

Go to the backend folder and install it's dependencies. After that, run in your terminal:

**NPM**
```bash
npm run setup
```

**Yarn**
```bash
yarn setup
```
This command will setup your database and seed with some initial data!
