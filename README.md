## Challenge

It was summer, and Lucy wanted a new toy, but she had no money to buy it. Lucy overheard her neighbors talking about how hot it was outside and how thirsty they had become.

That conversation gave her the idea to start a Juice stand. Soon, everyone wanted to buy Lucy's products, but her business grew so much that she started having problems organizing it.

Your goal is to help Lucy organize her business. She asked her older brother to build her a dashboard so she could analyze her business, but he only had time to make basic funcionality for his sister. That's where you come in!

### Context
Lucy needs help building her website so she can control everything that goes in and out of the shop.

To start her business, Lucy:
- She borrowed $5,000 from her parents as seed money.
- She pays $200/month to sell at the playground on weekdays.
- She pays $50/day to sell at the farmers market on weekends.

Look up any other business concepts you think will be useful!

### What does Lucy need?
- The historic sales data has been imported, but Lucy would like to move to recording her sales through a web app.
- Lucy would also like to add, delete, and manage her product catalog using the website.
- Build Charts and Tables for Lucy to manage her daily sales.
- Build a dynamic report for Lucy to present her revenue, expenses, and profit to her parents.
- What insight can you give Lucy regarding her business? She's interested in hourly trends, performance over time, profit per day of week.
- A more professional design would inspire confidence in her business, give it any special touches you see fit.
- What else do you think Lucy would be happy to have?

Choose and build solutions for 2 (or more) items on this list, depending on what skills you want to show off. You will have a chance to tell us about additional work that you would do given more time, so donâ€™t feel like you have to do everything. This should only be 4-6 hours of total effort.
